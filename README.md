### Web and Mobile Automated Testing Repository

This repository contains automated tests for both web and mobile applications. With the use of environment variables in IntelliJ IDEA, you can easily switch between running tests for web or mobile platforms. Also is integrated with axe-core tools to easily check web accessibility violations while running an automated web script.

### Getting Started
To set up your local environment and install dependencies for running the tests, follow these steps:

### Pre-requisites
Ensure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed on your system.
Make sure you have Maven installed and Java jdk 11 or superior.

Appium runs on Node.js. If you don't already have Node.js installed, download and install it from https://nodejs.org/en/download.

Step 2: Install Appium

Install Appium globally using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command: 

npm install -g appium

Step 3: Install Appium Dependencies

Appium has specific dependencies for different mobile development platforms. Install the necessary dependencies based on the platform you want to automate tests for.

### Android
Install Android Studio following the instructions on https://developer.android.com/studio/install.
Set up ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME environment variables correctly.

Step 4: Set Up Emulators or Physical Devices

Use Virtual Device Manager tool from Android Studio to start a customized Android emulator

Step 5: Start Appium Server

### Configure WebDriver (For Web Tests):

If you're running web tests, make sure you have the appropriate WebDriver installed and configured. You may need to download the WebDriver for your preferred browser and set the path accordingly.

### Configure Mobile Testing Environment (For Mobile Tests):

If you're running mobile tests, ensure you have the necessary emulators or devices set up and configured for testing. You may need to configure the mobile platform-specific settings accordingly.
